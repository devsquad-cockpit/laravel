Cockpit is a beautiful error tracking package that will help your software team to track and fix errors.

## Laravel Installation

This package is compatible with **Laravel 6+**.

#### Now you can install the package:

```bash
composer require devsquad-cockpit/laravel
```

#### Run the following command to install the package files:

```bash
php artisan cockpit:install
```

#### Configuring cockpit connection
After the installation, you should configure the connection with cockpit main application.
Open your `.env` file and check for this new env vars:

```env
COCKPIT_DOMAIN=
COCKPIT_ENABLED=
COCKPIT_TOKEN=
```
__`COCKPIT_DOMAIN`__: You must set your cockpit domain on this var. This way, our package will know where it should send the error data.
If your cockpit instance runs on a port different than the 80 or 443, you should add it too. E.g.: `http://cockpit.mydomain.com:9001`.

__`COCKPIT_ENABLED`__: With this var, you can control if cockpit features will be available or not.

__`COCKPIT_TOKEN`__: On this var, you should set the project token. With this, you instruct cockpit
in which project the errors will be attached.

## Reporting unhandled exceptions
You need to add the Cockpit as a log-channel by adding the following config to the channels section in config/logging.php:

```php
'channels' => [
    // ...
    'cockpit' => [
        'driver' => 'cockpit',
    ],
],
```
After that you need to add it to the stack section:

```php
'channels' => [
    'stack' => [
        'driver' => 'stack',
        'channels' => ['single', 'cockpit'],
    ],
    //...
],
```

## Testing if everything works

By the end you're being able to send a fake exception to test connection

```php
php artisan cockpit:test
```
